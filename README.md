# ROCm and Cuda compatibility headers

This is basically a set of headers to allow HIP to compile Cuda code without any or minor modifications.

Here I also include the HIP headers under [nvidia_detail](nvidia_detail) that AMD uses to compile HIP code on `nvcc`, the license should allow that.

- HIP CUDA headers: ROCm 5.4.3
- hipify-perl: ROCm 5.4.2
